Blinkit Power_Bi Dashboard

Problem Statement:
The Blinkit Power_Bi dashboard is designed to provide a detailed analysis of sales performance, outlet efficiency, and customer satisfaction across various regions and product categories. 
By analyzing the data, stakeholders can gain valuable insights into the following:

What contributes the most to total sales in terms of fat content, outlet type, and location tier?
Which outlets perform better based on size and establishment year?
How do product sales and customer ratings vary across different outlet types and product categories?
Which locations (T1, T2, T3 cities) offer the most revenue potential for expansion?
The dashboard's insights enable stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to optimize product placement, promotions, and resource allocation.

Steps to Import Data from Excel to Power BI

Step 1: Open Power BI Desktop
Launch Power BI Desktop to load the data and create the visualizations.

Step 2: Import Data from Excel
Click on the Home tab.
Select Get Data > Excel.
Browse and select the Excel file containing the sales data.
Choose the relevant sheet and click Load.

Step 3: Data Cleansing
Once the data is imported, follow these data cleansing steps to ensure accuracy:
Remove duplicates: Ensure there are no duplicate entries in the dataset.
Fix data types: Confirm that columns like sales figures, ratings, and item counts are formatted correctly (currency, decimal, whole numbers).
Handle missing values: Use techniques like replacing missing values with averages or leaving them blank if non-critical.
Create calculated columns: Add calculated fields, such as total sales, item visibility, and average ratings.
Rename columns: Use descriptive names for columns to improve readability and understanding of the data.

Step 4: Create Metrics for the Matrix Visualization
To create the matrix visualization, define the metrics you want to display. Use the following code snippet to define key performance metrics:
DAX
Metrics = {
    ("Total Sales", NAMEOF('BlinkIT Grocery Data'[Total Sales]), 0),
    ("Avg Sales", NAMEOF('BlinkIT Grocery Data'[Avg Sales]), 1),
    ("No of items", NAMEOF('BlinkIT Grocery Data'[No of items]), 2),
    ("Avg Rating", NAMEOF('BlinkIT Grocery Data'[Avg Rating]), 3)
}

Instructions to Create the Matrix:
Navigate to the Visualizations pane.
Select the Matrix chart option.
In the Rows section, add the categories you want to analyze (e.g., Outlet Type, Item Type, Tier Location).
In the Values section, insert the metrics you created using the above DAX code: Total Sales, Avg Sales, No of Items, Avg Rating.
Format the matrix with colors, fonts, and layouts to make it more readable and informative.
The matrix will now display how each category (such as outlet type, item type, or location) performs in relation to the metrics like total sales, average sales, number of items sold, and average ratings.
